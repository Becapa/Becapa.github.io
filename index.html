						<p>It is a period of unrest. In a stunning move, Emperor TheDonald 
							has taken control of the Presidency and the Senate.
							Amidst all of the chaos and frenzy there was a sly smuggler girl named Trin Solo.
							She had a trusty side-kick woorgie named Arielbacca.
							<br>
							<br>
							They were minding their own business on the desert planet of Tatooine, just walking around, 
							when they happened upon a couple of nerf-herding, Packer-backing, Jedi-wannabes (one a chick, 
							and one a dude) that were trying to plant a seed.</p>

						<p>Trin Solo figured she should point it out to them, "Tatooine is a desert planet. The soil here is not fertile
						for planting seeds." Arielbacca agreed with a bark.</p>
						<p>Not knowing what else to do and seeing Trin Solo's ship, the Millenium Falcon, off in the distance 
						the chick, Kelsi-wan Kenobi, asked Trin Solo and Arielbacca if they could help them find a planet where 
						their seed would grow.</p>
						<p>"Well, it'll be a very difficult and treacherous journey, but yes! We'll help!" Trin Solo replied.</p>
						<p>The dude, Mike Skywalker, humbly offered his gratitude, "We don't have any idea what might grow from this
						seed, but we can't thank you enough."</p>
						<p>And so the crew, now of size four, left Tatooine in search of a fertile planet.</p>
